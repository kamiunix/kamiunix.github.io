    I Worked on research projects under the supervision of Dr. Nur Zincir-Heywood and Dr. TokunboMakanju which applied genetic algorithms to software defined networking to provide a solution set to the controller placement problem with theoretical applications in moving target defence. The research brought me to Kyoto were it was published and presented at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) 2018.
